# ❄️ FrostGuard AI  
### AI-Enabled Early Frost Risk Prediction System

FrostGuard AI is an intelligent, explainable, and predictive software system designed to **detect, quantify, and predict frost risks** in vineyards and agricultural fields.  
Unlike traditional binary alert systems, FrostGuard AI models frost as a **gradual build-up process** and provides **early lead-time predictions with confidence**, enabling farmers to take timely protective actions.

## 🚩 Problem Statement
Frost events cause severe damage to high-value crops such as grapes. Existing solutions rely on:
- Single-point temperature thresholds
- Reactive alerts
- No severity or confidence estimation  

These approaches often trigger **late or false alarms**, leading to economic losses.

---

## 💡 Our Solution
FrostGuard AI introduces a **next-generation frost prediction pipeline** that combines:
- Physics-inspired risk modeling
- Multi-station spatial analysis
- Machine learning-based lead-time forecasting
- Explainable AI outputs

## 🌟 Key Innovations

### 1️⃣ Frost Build-Up Index (FBI)
A **novel continuous risk score (0–100)** that quantifies how close the system is to a damaging frost.

FBI integrates:
- 🌡 Temperature drop rate  
- ⏳ Cold persistence over time  
- 🌍 Spatial spread across stations  

This replaces binary alerts with **interpretable risk levels**:
- Safe
- Watch
- Warning
- High Risk
- Critical

---

### 2️⃣ Lead-Time Confidence Predictor
Instead of saying *“Frost at 2 AM”*, FrostGuard AI predicts:

> **“Frost likely in 3.1 hours ± confidence (89%)”**

This is achieved using a machine learning regression model trained on historical and synthetic frost scenarios.

---

### 3️⃣ Explainable AI
The system clearly explains:
- Why frost is predicted
- Which factors contributed the most
- Which stations are driving the risk

This makes the system **trustworthy and decision-ready**.
